materials for Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4

The run_analysis script here takes data from the given .txt files and runs them through a series of commands. Those commands filter out everything except the desired values for the measurements on the mean ("...mean") and standard deviation ("...std") for each measurement recorded as a variable name. There are separate observations listed for each Subject, as well as each Activty in the dataset. The "newdf" dataframe created by the script is tidy, because it has a single varibale name for each column and one observation of that variable in each row.

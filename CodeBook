This code book helps describe the variables, data, and transformatinos used to clean up the given dataset during week 4. 

VARIABLES:
  SUBJECT
    SUBJECTS #1-30
      Each of 30 subjects who articpated in the research are represented here with a number ranging from 1-30. All subjects were wearing a Samsung device         at the waist and data from the device accelerometers were gathered.
      
  ACTIVITY
    STANDING
      Subject data gathered while standing
    SITTING
      Subject data gathered while sitting
    LAYING
      Subject data gathered while laying
    WALKING
      Subject data gathered while walking
    WALKING_UPSTAIRS
      Subject data gathered while walking up stairs
    WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
      Subject data gathered while walking down stairs 
 
 MEASUREMENT DATA
    The measurement data is listed is the following sample: tBodyAcc-mean()-X 
        t --> meaurements taken with respect to time
          "f" --> measurements taken with respect to frequency
        Body --> measurements taken with respect to forces from the body of the subject
           "Gravity" --> measurements taken with respect to forces from gravity
        Acc --> measurements taken with respect to the device accelerometer
          "Gryo" --> measurement taken with respect to the device gyroscope
        mean --> measuremnts of the mean
          "std" --> measurements of the standard deviation
        X --> measurements taken with respect to the side-to-side (X) direction
          "Y" or "Z" --> measurements in the vertical (Y) and transverse (Z) directions
          
TRANSFORMATIONS ON DATA
  This data was read from files supplied with the assignment. The test set and train set were combined. The only the values for "mean" and "std" were         extracted and arranged in a new data frame. A series of lists was created from the subset data in order to split at the desired locations, apply a mean     calculation to each element, then combine the elements back into a tidy data frame at the end.
